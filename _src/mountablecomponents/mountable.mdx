title: Lifecycle of a Mountable
---

A `Mountable` represents a reusable unit responsible for hosting the logic to create, measure, and bind the content that the mountable component will render.

As illustrated in the [Creating a Mountable Component](mountable-component.mdx#creating-a-mountable-component) page, the `MountableComponent.render()` method should return a `Mountable` implementation and any `Style` object to be applied to the component on the `MountableRenderResult` object.

:::note
Mountable extends `RenderUnit`, which is a rendering primitive. For more information, see the [Introduction to RenderCore](introduction-to-rendercore.mdx/#renderunit) page.

## Lifecycle of a Mountable

A Mountable has four important stages in its lifecycle, which must occur in the following order:

1. [Content size measurement](#content-size-measurement)
1. [Creation](#creation-of-a-mountable)
1. [Content creation](#content-creation)
1. [Binding and unbinding content properties](#binding-and-unbinding-content-properties)

Each of these stages is detailed in the following sub-sections.

### Content size measurement

:::note
This stage of the mountable's lifecycle can occur on any thread.
:::

Each Mountable should implement a `measure()` function to define how it measures itself given arbitrary width and height specs. The `MeasureResult` object it returns contains the width and height of the content, and optionally any layout data, as shown in the following example:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/mountables/bindto/ImageViewComponent.kt start=measure_example_start end=measure_example_end
```

To learn about the different strategies to measure content, see the [Measuring](mountable-measuring.mdx) page.

### Creation of a Mountable

In order to create a Mountable, write a class that extends the [Mountable](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/rendercore/Mountable.html) abstract class. Implementations directly extending the `Mountable` class enable multiple [Binders](introduction-to-rendercore.mdx/#binder) to be specified to set and unset properties on the mounted content (see [Binding and unbinding content properties](#binding-and-unbinding-content-properties)).

In the majority of cases, a single `Binder` will be enough to implement the binding required for the `MountableComponent`.

For this reason, a `SimpleMountable` abstract class has been created, which encapsulates the logic of the `Binder` creation and addition. To implement setting and unsetting the properties of the content, just override `mount()`, `unmount()`, and, optionally, the `shouldUpdate()` method.

The following example provides an implementation of `SimpleMountable` in an `ImageView`:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/mountables/SimpleImageViewComponent.kt start=start_simple_mountable_example end=end_simple_mountable_example
```

### Content creation

:::note
This stage of the mountable's lifecycle can only occur on the main thread.
:::

Each Mountable needs to create the content it hosts (either a `View` or a `Drawable`) via a [ContentAllocator](introduction-to-rendercore.mdx/#contentallocator).

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/mountables/bindto/ImageViewComponent.kt start=create_content_example_start end=create_content_example_end
```

You should also pass the type of the created content to the `Mountable` super constructor, either `RenderType.VIEW` for views or `RenderType.DRAWABLE` for drawables.

:::note
The content should not be mutated based on props passed from MountableComponent to the Mountable.
:::

In order to optimize the mount performance, the `ContentAllocator` can also be used to define [content pooling](mountable-preallocation.mdx).

### Binding and unbinding content properties

:::note
This stage of the mountable's lifecycle can only occur on the main thread.
:::

A Mountable uses one or more [Binders](introduction-to-rendercore.mdx/#binder) to `bind()` and `unbind()` properties on the mounted content.

Each Binder should implement 3 methods:

- `bind()` - used to set properties.
- `unbind()` - used to unset properties.
- `shouldUpdate()` - used to decide whether properties need resetting.

The following code shows a component that extends `SimpleMountable`, where mount() is the equivalent of bind() and unmount() is the equivalent of unbind():

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/mountables/bindto/ImageViewComponent.kt start=mount_unmount_example_start end=mount_unmount_example_end
```

Each `Binder` should be added to the `Mountable` using the `addMountUnmountExtension()` method.

:::note Important
Once set, a property should be unset in the matching `unbind()` method to ensure correctness when the content is reused.
