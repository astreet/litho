`useRef` is a hook that allows a component to maintain a mutable reference that doesn't trigger a re-render when updated. It returns an instance of `Ref` which has a single mutable `value` property, which should only be read/written on the UI thread.

To familiarize yourself with the concept and rules for hooks, see the [Introduction to Hooks](hooks-intro.mdx) page.

## Managing UI Thread State with `useRef`

:::note
**Ref.value should only be read/written from the main thread.** Since there is no guarantee that a component's render function is executed on the main thread, it should not be accessed during the execution of render.

Some locations where it *is* safe to access and mutate `Ref.value`:

- `onClick` and other View events.
- `onVisible` and other visibility events.
- `useEffect` and its cleanup lambda.
:::

Appropriate use cases of `useRef` are best shown by example. Note that none of these examples read or write `useRef` off the main thread or during the execution of the main body of the component's `render()` function.

### Example: Logging Seen State

In the below code, `useRef` is used to track whether we've handled the `onVisible` event previously. Updating `hasLoggedVisible.value` to true doesn't trigger a re-render, unlike storing and updating it via `useState`.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/LogOnceComponent.kt start=start_useref_example end=end_useref_example
```

### Example: Starting/Stopping Animators

In the below code, an animator is started and stopped when the Component is attached/detached on the main thread. It uses `useRef` to maintain a reference to the Animator created when the Component was attached.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/animations/animatedcounter/AnimatedCounter.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

## Pairing with `useEffect`

Pairing `useRef` with `useEffect` is a common pattern. For more information on `useEffect`, see the code samples in the [useEffect](/mainconcepts/use-effect.mdx) page.
